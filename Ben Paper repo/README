# Modelling Trigeminal Projection Neurons

This project aims to model trigeminal projection neurons using NEURON, a simulation environment for neural networks.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the behavior and properties of trigeminal projection neurons through computational modeling. By simulating the electrical activity of these neurons, we can gain insights into their firing patterns, synaptic connections, and response to various stimuli.

## Installation

To run the simulations and experiments in this project, you will need to install NEURON. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment:

1. Download NEURON from the official website (https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download).
2. Install NEURON according to the provided instructions for your operating system.
3. Verify the installation by running a simple NEURON script.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open NEURON and load the project files.
3. Modify the parameters and settings as needed for your experiments.
4. Run the simulations and analyze the results.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 to explore different scenarios and hypotheses.
