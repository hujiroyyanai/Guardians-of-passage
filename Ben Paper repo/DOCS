Projection neurons was simulated using the NEURON simulation enviornment (Hines and Carnevale 1997). Projection neurons were aproximated as single compartment cylindrical models with both diameter and lenght of 45.75 μm.
The size of the model was chosen so as to achieve the measured avarege capacitance of 65.8 pF with a standard 1 μF/cm^2. The passive conductance value (g_pas) used, was determined according to the measured input resistance (614 MΩ) and is equal to 1.02e-5 S/cm^2. The potassium equalibrium potential was set at -88.85 mV in accordance with our experimental set up.
Three aditional mechnisms other then passive conductance are used in the model, a Hodgekin Huxley mechanism, a KDR potassium current mechanism, and an Ia potassium current mechanism.
All mechanisms were taken from (Prescott et al. 2022) and left unchanged except for the Ia mechanism in which the inactivation parameter l, was altered to follow a double exponential curve rather then the standard single exponential in order to adhere to our experimental measurments which apear to follow a double exponential decay.
All model parameters were chosen in accordance with our experimental measurments and are available on github.
